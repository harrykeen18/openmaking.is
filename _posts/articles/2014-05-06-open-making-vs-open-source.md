    open making be released open source?

Coming soon.

=> whereas open source is a property of a computer programme, one directly
   derived from the nature of computer programmes, that they're written in
   source code and compiled to binary to be executed by a computer
=> open making is more analogous to collaborative development than open source
=> not synonymous with open hardware, or open product designs


* open source is (if you'll forgive the term) binary: it's very easy to determine
  whether a product is open source or not. Do you have a copy of the source code?
  Does the license allow you to use, reuse, and redistribute it?
* open making is fuzzy -- and especially historically so


disclaimer: od dev, interest in the definition and understanding of the term
(that's why writing this!); but to be very clear: I am not writing this to
claim that OpenDesk.cc is or is not open source. I am a career long committed
open source developer (OS repos; UNLICENSE credit, etc.) and as such I know
what Open Source is. As it happens, OpenDesk.cc carries *both open source and
proprietary designs* and I'm very comfortable with that. What I am not
comfortable with is being told that we're not "Open Making" because some of
our designs are under CC-NC licenses. That's the fundamental misunderstanding
that I've argued against here.

raw material supply / CAD tools: just as much part of the process
