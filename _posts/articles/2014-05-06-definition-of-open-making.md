Open making is a new model of product design and manufacture that is based on
digital fabrication and has been inspired by open source thinking. The essential
feature of the new model is that it de-couples design and manufacture so that
products can be made reliably and repeatably, independently of their designer.

## A new model of product design and manufacture

Until recently, it was rare to find a product company where designs weren't
developed behind closed doors and manufacturing techniques weren't closely
guarded secrets. Open making is a new way of approaching product design and
manufacture that turns this on its head, so that designs and manufacturing
techniques are neither siloed nor proprietary.

It's important to emphasise that open making is a process, and that any
particular process can be more or less open in multiple ways:

1. designs are created, modelled and distributed using specific file formats
1. products are made using specific making technology and hardware platforms
1. licenses and processes can restrict or enable use and evolution of designs

As a process, open making is [analogous][] with the concept of collaborative
software development: some projects are more or less open or collaborative,
rather than being exclusively open or closed. A project like [WikiHouse][] aims
to be fully open at all points. A project like [OpenDesk][] introduces legal
restrictions on use of designs, whilst taking pains to make them universally
makable. A project like [WikiSpeed][] takes great pains to open and
democratise the design process and iterate in response to feedback whilst
producing cars that are necessarily specialised to manufacture.

## Based on digital fabrication technology

Digital fabrication is a type of manufacturing process where the machine used is
controlled by a computer. The most common forms of digital fabrication are:

* [CNC Machining][]: where, typically, shapes are cut out of wooden sheets
* [3D Printing][]: where objects are built up out of layers of metal or plastic
* [Laser Cutting][]: where materials like metal are burnt or melted by a laser beam

The two important aspects that unify these techniques are that the machines:

1. can reliably make consistent products from digital designs
1. are flexible enough to make a wide range of products

Open making doesn't have to be based on digital fabrication. However, computers
are so good at following instructions that digital fabrication technologies take
repeatability to a new level. Because the technology is so flexible, it becomes
a standard that designers and makers can cohere around. A maker who owns a CNC
machine or a 3D printer can make all products that are designer for that process.
A designer who designs a product to be made using digital fabrication immediately
gains a manufacturing base.

The paradigm shift is reminiscent of the printing press. Before printing was
invented, manuscripts could be copied, often with reasonable accuracy. However,
afterwards, the ease, speed and accuracy of printing took replication -- and
literacy -- to a new level.

## Inspired by open source thinking

* what we've seen since the printing press is computers and the Internet
* replication went from cheap to free
* spawned geek and open-source culture

* key tenets have been flattened hierarchies and collaborative development --
  no more bosses and the serendipity of the pull request
* repeatability and automation: from the re-use of scripts and functions as
  modules and libraries and from the automation of tasks to services to
  deployments: exponential payback of painstaking mastering for automation

* unique opportunity to experiment with culture yielded new ways of doing
  things that, as mainstreamed, have then transforming other domains and
  industries
* no surprise that product design and manufacture are one of these domains
* products are turtles as much as computers
* products exist in an ecosystem just as computer programmes
* fertile ground for exploration: a generation of hackers figuring out how
  to take products and manufacturing out of its siloes

## That de-couples design and manufacturing

* see a fraction of this from the products and videos on this site
* wide variety in approaches: pure open source hardware, through to
social product design and personalisation
* the key element that's consistent across all projects is the de-coupling
  of design and manufacture
* contrast with siloed and proprietary manufacturing is that designs are
  widely available (not gatekept) and products are explicitly designed so
  that they can be made by someone else -- ideally as many people as possible
* just as software is packaged to be build and made on many machines, products

* so this definition of open making is that of a model, inspired by digital fab
  and open source, that allows designs to be made reliably and repeatably
  "outside of the building", without involvement of the original brand or
  designer
